Gitty - Web deployment made graphically

Gitty is a deployment tool for software (most cases should be websites) over FTP and other protocols
its written in PHP and has a graphically interface written in HTML

Requires the following:
- git
- web server (Apache, Lighttpd etc)
- PHP 5.1 or higher

How to setup?

just copy the code where u like to, and make sure u pass GITTY_CONFIG environment variable to point
to your config file, so the index.php and console.php can locate them. Edit the bootstrap.php as wenn,
if you like. the config.ini is included

Thanks to the Zend Framework for many good ideas!
