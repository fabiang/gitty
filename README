Gitty - Web deployment made graphically

Gitty is a deployment tool for software over FTP and other protocols
its written in PHP and has a graphically interface written in HTML.

Requirements of Gitty:
- git
- web server (Apache, Lighttpd etc)
- PHP 5.3

- How to setup?
  just copy the code where u like to, and make sure you pass GITTY_CONFIG
  environment variable to point to your config file, so the index.php and
  console.php can locate them. Edit the bootstrap.php if you like.
  A example config.ini is included.

Thanks to the Zend Framework for many good ideas!
